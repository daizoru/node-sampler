node-recorder


## What is it

 A library which record things and play them back

## What?

 Record byte streams / events (eg. twitter, music, IRC, Apache logs..) and play them back (eg. to test or debug a stream/event based app, reproduce HTTP errors, simulate message queue stuff)

On the of basic features is that you can control the rate speed, which is very useful to train machine learning algorithms on difficult to get / sparse / slow data (eg. social networks)

## Current status

  This library is still in development.
  It is first designed for a private project so expect refactoring, and few updates until I have more to to settle everything.
