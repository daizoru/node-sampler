# node-recorder


## What is it

 A library which record things and play them back

## What?

 Record byte streams/events (eg. twitter, music, IRC, Apache logs..) and play them back (eg. to test or debug an app, reproduce errors, simulate events)

One the of main features is that you can control the rate speed, 
very useful to train machine learning algorithms on historic data (eg. Twitter streams)

## Current status

  This library is still in development so expect heavy refactoring and sparse documentation until I have more time to settle everything.
